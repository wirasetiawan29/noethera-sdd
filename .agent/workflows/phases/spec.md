# Phase 1: Spec

Before Design or Implement.

## Checklist

- [ ] **Goal** — One sentence: what are we building or fixing?
- [ ] **Scope in** — What is included?
- [ ] **Scope out** — What is explicitly excluded? (YAGNI)
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** — Testable, concrete. At least one per goal.

## For bugs

- [ ] **Reproduction steps** — Minimal steps to reproduce.
- [ ] **Expected vs actual** — Clear difference.
- [ ] **Definition of done** — "Bug fixed = …"

## Rule

If the user's message is vague, ask one or two short questions. Do not proceed until spec is locked.
